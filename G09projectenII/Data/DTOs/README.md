# DTO Disclaimer
These DTO's are purely used to be able to get the necessary JSON data with the AJAX calls for the session modal. 
This modal is triggered when pressing an event in the calendar. 

In calendar.js, the disclaimer explains it best:
> This js file is not the most pretty file in existance.
> It is also not what was intended for the project.
> We just wanted a better UX by showing a modal when the user clicks the event in the calendar.
> The calendar is fullcalendar, and generates the html from js. We could therefore not access the html with MVC.
> We did however make GET requests and DTO's to update this modal dynamically.
> If you would like to see how we did it in the MVC-way: check the session details page (Session views and SessionController)
